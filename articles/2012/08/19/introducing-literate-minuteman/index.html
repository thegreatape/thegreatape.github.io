<h2 class='title is-2'>Introducing Literate Minuteman</h2>

<div class='date subtitle is-5'>August 19, 2012</div>

<div class='content'><p>It’s a little odd to be writing an introduction to something I’ve been actively working on and using for the better part of a year. I think I’ve fallen into the trap of wanting to add just one more thing and polishing that one feature before showing the world what I’ve made.</p>

<p>So, hello world. Here’s <a href="http://minuteman.zen-hacking.com">Literate Minuteman</a>. It’s a free service to check the books on your <a href="http://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> to-read list against your local library’s catalogue, letting you know which books are available and where, right now.</p>

<p>You can use it to see which books the whole library system has, or those at just a particular branch, or those at a particular set of branches—for example, those closest to your house. You can also use custom lists from Goodreads; instead of my to-read list, I’m using a list that has everything I’ve been meaning to read, but don’t actually own.</p>

<p>Right now, the supported library systems are the BPL and Minuteman networks in the greater Boston area and the Orange County system in North Carolina. This is simply because I live in Boston and have friends and family in Orange County, so that’s what I’ve written so far! I’ve tried to create a set of helpers to make it pretty easy to add new libraries: it just requires a bit of Ruby code and the library to have a publicly accessible catalog search on the web. Both <a href="https://github.com/thegreatape/literate-minuteman">pull requests on Github</a> and alcoholic bribes are encouraged ways to get your local library supported.</p>

<p>There’s a ton of improvements I’m working on, particularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Better mobile support. The site’s workable on a smartphone right now, but the design could be more responsive and badly needs offline support. The Cambridge main library’s science fiction section is in the basement and, as far as I can tell, was built inside a Faraday cage for all the cell phone signal I get in there. I’ve got <a href="https://github.com/thegreatape/literate-minuteman/tree/backbone">work on this</a> underway right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call number support. No reason to have to go to a terminal or card catalog while at the library find out where the book is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for services like <a href="http://paperbackswap.com">PaperBackSwap</a>. There’s an ISBN-importing Javascript thing I use to import my Goodreads wishlist to PaperBackSwap, but I have to remember to run it manually. This should be easier.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If it sounds like Literate Minuteman tickles your fancy, <a href="http://minuteman.zen-hacking.com">give it a whirl</a> and let me know what I can do to make it more useful for you; this is very much a labor of love.</p>
