<h2 class='title is-2'>Defusing Distracting Defaults: An Experiment In Automating Better Habits</h2>

<div class='date subtitle is-5'>August 28, 2016</div>

<div class='content'><p>Ever have one of those moments where you’re browsing Instagram/Facebook/Twitter/whatever, realize you’ve burned an hour you meant to use working on something else, close the tab in disgust… then realize you’ve reopened the same site without even thinking about it?</p>

<p>Yeah. Long, uninterrupted blocks of focus are incredibly important for creative work. But for me, good intentions alone ain’t gonna get me there.</p>

<p>There are plenty of distracting things blockers for OS X out there: StayFocusd, Freedom, Focus, and I’m sure tons more. But none that I tried quite worked for me, and I’ve been trying to think about why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Permanently blocking distractions</em>: Absolute blocking works for things that I actually get no value out of (Hacker News, I’m looking at you). But the most insidious stuff are sites that I sometimes get value from: keeping up with friends on Twitter, the good parts of Reddit, and so on. I still want to use them, just… deliberately and not instead of what I mean to be working on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Fixed amount of time per day</em>: A fixed time allowance for distraction sounds good in theory, but it doesn’t prevent me from absent-mindedly opening distractions at the start of the day, which is typically when I have the most energy I’d like to spend on something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Scheduled blocking</em>: I could never figure out the right schedule that wound up helping, to be honest.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Upon reflection, I think what I wanted was a mindfulness aid. Ideally, I’d have all distractions blocked by default when I open my laptop, and have a command that I run to be able to access distractions for a set period of time, reverting to blocking everything when done: a break with an enforced time limit. I could run as many of these as I want, but each time has to be a deliberate decision.</p>

<p>None of the existing tools quite did this, but I was able to wire up something that did. Here’s how:</p>

<h2 id="1-install-focus">1. Install Focus</h2>

<p><a href="https://heyfocus.com/">Focus</a> is a great distraction blocking app for OS X and well worth your money. It has two modes: scheduled blocking or manually enabled periods of blocking, neither of which are quite what I was after.</p>

<p>Luckily, it’s scriptable.</p>

<h2 id="2-install-hammerspoon-and-start-focus-on-wake">2. Install Hammerspoon and start Focus on wake</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a> is an automation tool for OS X that can watch for events and run Lua scripts in response. It’s quite powerful and the APIs are pretty extensive. I set it up to start Focus upon system wake, so even if I’ve disabled Focus earlier or closed my laptop in the middle of a break, when I come back, Focus is running.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua"><span class="c1">--</span>
<span class="c1">-- ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</span>
<span class="c1">-- start Focus.app on wake</span>
<span class="c1">--</span>
<span class="kd">local</span> <span class="n">wakeCallback</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">nil</span>

    <span class="n">hs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'open focus://focus'</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">wakeWatcher</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">caffeinate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">watcher</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wakeCallback</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">wakeWatcher</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="3-set-up-unfocus-break-script">3. Set up unfocus break script</h2>

<p>The final piece is a script I wrote myself—it turns off blocking for a fixed period, then re-enables it at the end, keeping me from turning what I meant to be 5 minutes of break into a lost hour or two.</p>

<p>Put the following somewhere on your path and make it executable:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">unfocus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">remaining</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="sb">`open focus://unfocus`</span>
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">remaining</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"&gt;&gt; Unfocused, refocusing in </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">format_time</span> <span class="n">remaining</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">     </span><span class="se">\r</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="n">remaining</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="nb">sleep</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">format_time</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">remaining</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="s2">"%02d:%02d"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">remaining</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">divmod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">refocus</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">Break over!"</span>
  <span class="sb">`open focus://focus`</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">begin</span>
  <span class="n">unfocus</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="no">ARGV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_i</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">refocus</span>
<span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">Interrupt</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">e</span>
  <span class="n">refocus</span>
  <span class="nb">exit</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The break defaults to 15 minutes, but you can pass a custom number as an argument to the script (so <code class="highlighter-rouge">unfocus 5</code> gives you a 5 minute break). When run, it’ll display a countdown timer of how long your break has remaining, then exit and re-enable Focus. It’ll even re-enable Focus if you accidentally kill the script while it’s running.</p>

<p>And that’s it! I’ve just gotten this set up today, but I’m pleased with how it’s working so far. Time will tell if it’s a good long-term solution for me.</p>

<p><em>Updated Feb 26th, 2017: A previous solution here used <a href="http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/">sleepwatcher</a>, but it began starting slowly after upgrading to Sierra. I replaced it with with Hammerspoon.</em></p>
