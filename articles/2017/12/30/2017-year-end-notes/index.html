<h2 class='title is-2'>2017 Year End Notes</h2>

<div class='date subtitle is-5'>December 30, 2017</div>

<div class='content'><p>Another year, another time for personal reflection and course adjustments.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I noted last year that I’d read mostly books by men (women made up only 23% of my 2016 reading list), and wanted to change that. This year, I did! 25 of the 50 books I read were by women.</p>

<p>Rough breakdown by genre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fantasy: 23 books</li>
  <li>Other Non-Fiction: 12 books</li>
  <li>Science Fiction: 7 books</li>
  <li>Technical	 / Career: 4 books</li>
  <li>Fitness: 4 books</li>
</ul>

<p>Notable books from 2017:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not-ebook/dp/B003K15IOE/">Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)</a>: A book about self-justification, cognitive dissonance, and how memory works. This had more impact on how I think about human behavior than anything else I’ve read in the last few years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality-ebook/dp/B019B6VCLO">Weapons of Math Destruction</a>: A good, nuanced critique of how big data techniques can contribute to social ills. Far from a “big data BAD!” screed, the author lays out a thoughtful set of criteria that we can use to evaluate the impact of individual algorithms and approaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/">The Manager’s Path</a>: An excellent book on tech leadership, and one that I hope individual contributors will read at least the first few chapters of as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Infomocracy-Book-One-Centenal-Cycle-ebook/dp/B0151U75ME/">Infomocracy</a>: If William Gibson wrote near-future fiction about governments and elections, it might look something like this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wheel-Time-14-Book/dp/B00VZIF6VO">The Wheel of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dresden-Files-15-books/dp/B00O3HD47C/">The Dresden Files</a>: While I’m not normally a big re-reader, this year was a year for revisiting some old favorites.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m generally happy with where my reading habits are right now, but I think next year it might be a good idea to start paying more attention to how many books I’m reading by people of color and publicly LGBTQ+ authors.</p>

<p><em>Updated 2017-12-31: wound up finishing two more books on New Year’s Eve!</em></p>

<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>
<p>Spending the last year focusing on getting healthy and hypertrophy paid off. I didn’t get hurt again, and definitely got bigger: went from 182lbs to 202lbs from March to December, with relatively mild fat gains. I’ll be cutting that down starting post-vacation in January, aiming to get down to 190lbs or so before I start another muscle gain phase.</p>

<p>I only did 1RM testing once this year (in mid-July, I think) but I got back to my pre-injury strength levels, with a small deadlift PR. Not bad, considering strength was a secondary focus.</p>

<p>Good things from 2017 I want to continue doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Safety Squat Bar</em>: I got a <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/sb-1-rogue-safety-squat-bar">safety squat bar</a> for the home gym when both my wife and I had upper body injuries, and I wound up squatting with it exclusively for about six months. Even though I’m back to regular back squats as a main lift, I’ll still be using the SSB for accessory and supplemental lifts for the foreseeable future. Great purchase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Meal prep + calorie macro tracking</em>: A flexible diet framework that still seems to work super well for me on both the physical results and mental health fronts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Giant sets (for accessory work)</em>: Giant sets are stringing together 3 or more lifts in sequence, without a pause. They’re A+ for time and mild conditioning. I tried to doing them for a while with my main lifts, and got a few minor tweaks that I think were warning shots. I’ll keep doing giant sets but just for isolation-y accessories and not with the main lifts of the day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Biking and walking for LISS</em>: I feel like I have to re-learn this one every year: HIIT is fun and time-efficient, but the recovery tax is too high for what they get me. I /mostly/ stuck to biking and hiking for cardio this year, and it improved my work capacity and got me outside, without beating me all to hell.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have one simple goal for next year: commit to running <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-toolkit/">Average to Savage</a> for the whole year. I program-hopped for the last half of the year too much, and it impacted my strength progress. I know AtS works for my goals, and I should stick to just periodically adjusting accessory work if I need variation.</p>

<h2 id="time-and-attention">Time and Attention</h2>
<p>Even considering the psychological and emotional weight of the country turning into a flaming dumpster full of garbage fires, I’m still unhappy with the job I did spending my time and attention deliberately in 2017.</p>

<p>That’s reflected in this being the only post I’ve written in this whole year, the lowest number since I started it in 2011.</p>

<p>Last year, I said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So 2017 will probably see less learning of new tools and more general studying of topics I lack depth in. I’m planning to start with working through The Elements of Computing Systems and we’ll see how it goes from there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did approximately jack shit towards that goal, or really anything related to it. I struggled to even read books about things I wanted to learn, about computers or <em>anything</em>, much less actually building anything. I’ve been underestimating how much of a rut I’ve fallen into here, and I’m really not ok with it. Something’s got to give.</p>

<p>I’ve tried a lot of things to change my habits here and almost all of it has failed. In the past, I’ve focused on trying to suppress distractions, doing stuff like setting up <a href="http://thegreata.pe/defusing-distracting-defaults">automated content-blocking</a>. I think perhaps I haven’t given enough attention to the flip side: filling up that distraction free time with challenging things I want to do. I’m trying some techniques that I’m hopeful will help (chiefly, <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/">variations on time blocking</a>), but I feel like I need a more concrete goal that’ll give me a hard push in the right direction.</p>

<p>So: <em>in 2018, I’m going to try averaging one post a week here about something I’m learning, practicing or building</em>. These can be about any subject, and any length. I’m expecting this to be tough. I think trying for a rough weekly cadence is a good start, though I expect there will be some variation. I’m also giving myself a pass for any week where I’m on vacation, which might be a good incentive to take more of it!</p>

<h2 id="onwards">Onwards</h2>
<p>Ok, 2018. Let’s do this.</p>
