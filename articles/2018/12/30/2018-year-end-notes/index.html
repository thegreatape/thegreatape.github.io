      <p>At the end of 2018, looking inwards. How did that go?</p>

<h2 id="dog">Dog</h2>
<p>In April, my wife and I adopted a puppy! This is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ripleyromps/">Ripley</a>—she’s a German Shepherd / Basset Hound / ¯\_(ツ) /¯ mix that we adopted through <a href="https://www.gdrne.com/">Great Dog Rescue New England</a>. (For the record, that’s “Lieutenant Ellen” not “Believe It Or Not”.)</p>

<p><img src="/images/ripley-winter.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>She’s been a wonderful addition to the household, and we’ve spend much of the year learning how to Life With Dog.</p>

<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>
<p>From last year:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have one simple goal for next year: commit to running <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-toolkit/">Average to Savage</a> for the whole year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did this! And it worked pretty well. Over the course of three runs through the program, I put 45 lbs on my squat and deadlift training maxes, 22.5 lbs on bench press, and maybe 5 lbs on overhead press. I haven’t tested true 1RMs all year, but rep maxes have all been moving in the right direction. Most importantly for my goals: I got modestly more jacked, definitely can handle more volume, and <em>didn’t get hurt</em>.</p>

<p>For 2019, I’d like to take the base I built this year and push my top-end strength up to make progress towards my long-term 2/3/4/5 plate goals for press/bench/squat/deadlift. I’ll definitely be committing to another single program for a long stretch of time, at least six months. Maybe a year. The leading candidate is something <a href="http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html">GZCL method</a>-based. I’m giving myself until I get back from visiting family in the second week of January to firmly commit to the specifics.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I read less than my usual this year, only finishing 31 books. Seven of these were over 700 page fantasy doorstoppers, so that’s not <em>quite</em> as low as sounds, but it’s still substantially less than last year. I think a gentle nudge to spend a few more evenings reading is in order here.</p>

<p>Rough breakdown by genre:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fantasy: 15</li>
  <li>Nonfiction: 7</li>
  <li>Scifi: 5</li>
  <li>Fitness: 4</li>
</ul>

<p>On the diversity-of-authors front: of 31 books read, 14 were by women, 3 were by people of color and 4 were by publicly LGBTQ authors.</p>

<p>Notable books from 2018:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep">Why We Sleep</a> An eye-opening book on shuteye (sorry). I’ve been on the sleep-is-super-important train for a while, but this absolutely underscored how critical good sleep is to a live well-lived.</li>
  <li><a href="om/book/show/7743175-a-memory-of-light">A Memory Of Light</a> As a teenager, I must have read and re-read what had been published of the Wheel of Time maybe three or four times. Re-reading the series beginning last year felt like visiting old friends; finally reading the end two decades later was quite emotional.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking In Bets</a> A great read on decision making and risk; “resulting” has permanently entered my vocabulary at this point.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/thegreatape/status/972995638794358784">quit using Twitter</a> in March. My reasons at the time were time and attention-based, but I think what’s kept me from coming back is how much better it’s been for my mental health. I miss some of the connections I had with people there, but I don’t miss taking a cortisol bath every time I opened Tweetdeck.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year trying out different tools and techniques for organizing notes and todos.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I used <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> as my primary notes and todo app for a lot of the year. I really really loved its polished markdown editing, but I had to abandon it after I ran into some ugly/mysterious syncing problems (showing up to 1:1s with team members and having the last few months of notes gone is <em>not</em> fun).</li>
  <li>I tried <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journaling</a> for a month or so. I liked the self-reflection habit it enabled, but needing to continually scan pages for loose ends wasn’t for me and a physical notebook isn’t good for ubiquitous capture of ideas, especially on public transit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> has a lot going for it as notes / todo / personal wiki app, but it didn’t quite all hang together after a few weeks of use. The typography / layout were a little awkward, it was difficult to use without touching the mouse, and it was slow and laggy in that just-enough-to-be-annoying way that Electron apps often have. I think I’d happily use it as a part of a team at work, though.</li>
  <li>I’m currently trying out <a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a> for notes and writing: this post has been largely written using it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://habitica.com">Habitica</a> has been surprisingly (and slightly embarrassingly) effective at helping me stick to daily / weekly habits. I’m also using it for todo tracking, not because it’s super great at that, but because the habit part makes sure I’m actually looking at my lists daily.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t have a ton of time to play games, and tend to go all-in on a single game at a time. I played a lot of <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/">Overwatch</a> early in the year, but found it was only really fun when playing with friends I actually knew. Switched over to playing <a href="https://www.warframe.com/">Warframe</a> since, and it’s been a blast.</p>

<h2 id="learning--attention">Learning / Attention</h2>
<p>Last year, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>…in 2018, I’m going to try averaging one post a week here about something I’m learning, practicing or building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That did not go well. Right off the bat, I had trouble hitting that weekly cadence. Working through <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> was slow and trying to get a weekly piece written on it felt more like producing a grade school book report than sharing the joy and satisfaction of learning. I disliked how these pieces read enough to <a href="https://thegreata.pe/logbook/">push them off the front page</a> of this blog.</p>

<p>Falling further and further behind added stress and guilt instead of getting me excited. When my wife and I adopted Ripley at eight weeks old in April, my free time and sleep schedule got put in a blender for most of the summer. I never really got back on track, aside from a brief burst of hilariously overestimating my time and mental energy in <a href="https://thegreata.pe/logbooks/2018-06-24-15/">starting a learn to draw course</a>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of stories out there about people using methods like this to accomplish great creative endeavors (famously, Jerry Seinfeld’s daily <a href="https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/">don’t break the chain</a>). I wouldn’t rule out this approach from ever working for me, but this particular implementation was clearly a very poor fit.</p>

<p>What can I take away from this failure? It may have come down to this: learning is not a linear process. You go through through long periods of struggling to absorb and integrate new information before any breakthroughs happen. In setting that concrete writing goal, I trying to graft a nonlinear progression onto a strict schedule. Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that it backfired on me.</p>

<p>I still need to find a process that works for me. I still think a lot about <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a> and want to push towards a place where that kind of deep, meaningful focus and work is a regular part of my life. So: for 2018, I’m going to run a bunch of experiments to see what I can get to stick, maybe one a month or so. I might share the results, but probably not until year’s end when I’ve had a long time to see how the successful tests play out.</p>
