        <p>Continuing my slow plod through TEoCS (also known as <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a>), I’ve now reached the part of building in building a computer where I’ve built something that… computes.</p>

<p>The <em>Arithmetic Logic Unit</em> chip is the first thing I’ve made that felt like it deserved the label “chip” instead of the mechanical-sounding “gate”.  Just like everything else so far, at its heart it’s a bunch Nand gates with a lot of wires running between them… but it feels like we’ve crossed over from simple logic reified by wires into the real start of a more general purpose computing machine. The chip has a pair of 16-bit inputs, and 6 control bits, which you manipulate to do various combinations of arithmatic, from producing a constant value, addition, subtraction, bitwise boolean operations, negation upon those inputs. We’ll apparently be implementing multiplication and division at a higher level up the stack, but that’s a still a lot for some jumped-up simulated silicon.</p>

<p>It was, remarkably, only 14 lines of HDL code to implement, using all the gates I’d built so far.</p>

<p>It would have been pretty easy to rip through this chapter and build the ALU by just blindly implementing the logical operations indicated in the chip’s truth table and control bits, but I wanted to take a step back and work out with pen and paper <em>how</em> the chip actually accomplished a bunch of this math. It wasn’t obvious at all to me that, “ok, negate the y bus’s bits, then add them to x and then negate the result of that” comes out to <code class="highlighter-rouge">x-y</code>. But it does, and I’ve at least moved past taking it on faith after working out a few of these operations out with ink and dead trees. Pretty elegant design!</p>

<p>A few tidbits that were helpful for me as I worked through this chapter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can use the literal values <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> if you want a wired to be always on or off.  This eluded me for a bit (heh heh heh).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tests will produce a (relatively) easy to read output file as they go. At least on OS X, it’s difficult to see the entirety of this output in the simulator’s UI, but it’s also available in a file in the current project directory with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.out</code> extension. You can eyeball or diff each of its lines versus the test script’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">.cmp</code> file to start seeing where things have gone wrong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examining the state of each internal pin of the chip in the hardware simulator is a great debugging technique. I found plenty of bugs by just running the test script, waiting for it to fail on a particular case, then stepping through what each internal pin/bus’s value should have been on paper.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <div class="article-wrap" itemprop="text">
        <p>Last week, I cracked open <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">The Elements of Computing Systems</a> and started working through it. It’s a book with a pretty cool idea: it walks you through thirteen projects that all build upon each other to create a complete general-purpose computer. The first chapter starts with transistors and logic gates; the last has Tetris running on an operating system you wrote!</p>

<p>My posts about work towards this year’s learning-and-doing goal have thus far been either been documenting a finished project or showcasing immediately usable tips and tricks. Working my way through this book is going to be a little different. I want to document my progress—hopefully without these posts sounding like a third-grade book report—so I’m just going to try and call out what was fun or interesting about the material as I work through it. Maybe a work journal like this will be a useful template for how to write about other longer, ongoing projects, but we’ll see! This is all serving as a proxy for habit changes, which is the most important thing to me.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first chapter of TEoCS has you building primitive boolean logic gates starting with just a single atom: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate">Nand gate</a>. You progressively build more and more complicated gates, from the familiar Not/Or/And operators to stuff like multiplexors and n-way version of the earlier gates.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t come with a soldering iron, so this is all wired up inside a hardware simulator program (that reminds me of being introduced to pointers machine-language first in <a href="https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/210/syllabus.html">CS210</a>). You wire up the gates by writing code in Hardware Definition Language: basically virtually naming all the chips and how wires connect them.  You can load into the simulator, and then change the value of various wires and see what happens. It’s a baroque-looking program, but pretty useful for exploring and debugging:</p>

<p><a href="/images/xor.png"><img src="/images/xor.png" alt="hardware simulator" /></a></p>

<p>Delightfully, the material has a set of test scripts that you can use to put your gates through their paces and make sure you’ve wired up everything correctly.</p>

<p>Creating gates like this via code definitely stretched my brain. Sketching them out on pen and paper was was really helpful:</p>

        <p>I’ll admit I approached Haskell with a bit of trepidation: the language has a tongue-in-cheek unofficial motto of “avoid success at all costs” and a reputation of only being used by academic ivory-tower types.</p>

<h3 id="functional-strength">Functional Strength</h3>

<p>Haskell’s functional programming model is pure as the driven snow: unlike some of the functional languages earlier in the book, there’s no mutatable state whatsoever. Period, end of story. Like all the previous functional languages, lists of data are a first-class primitive and there are a number of tools for slicing and dicing them. The usual map/filter/fold suspects are around, as are succinct form for defining anonymous functions and some powerful list comprehension forms.</p>

<p>Lazy evaluation seems to be the default mode in Haskell. Under the hood, every function has a single argument—functions with multiple arguments are split into multiple functions that are then applied to each other. This allows for easy currying—saving functions with partially bound arguments for later full evaluation. These partially applied functions let you do some pretty nifty tricks, like incrementing a list via <code class="highlighter-rouge">map (+ 1) [1, 2, 3]</code>. Lazy evaluation also allows functions to be infinite generators without any special invocation or magic.</p>

<h3 id="not-my-type">Not My Type</h3>

<p>Haskell, while strongly typed, requires surprisingly little type declaration—the type checker can infer much of what it needs from the structure of the code. You can define your own types quite easily, both in terms of other types and recursively. These recursive definitions can lead to some very terse expressions of complex concepts - a one-line tree type definition, for example.</p>

<p>After all that, I have to admit that I don’t totally grok Haskell’s type system. Fighting with type error messages in GHC is what prevented me from doing most of the non-trivial exercises in this chapter. It’s apparent that once you learn to use it well, Haskell’s type system is sophisticated and very powerful—but for me, the learning curve proved greater than my enthusiasm for the language. Perhaps I’m spoiled by more dynamically-typed languages.</p>

<h3 id="monads-or-what-is-this-i-dont-even">Monads (Or, What Is This I Don’t Even)</h3>

<p>The book attempts to explain monads initially through an example involving drunken pirates, which is a perfectly good stand-in for my mental state while trying understand how monads work. The idea—I think—is a generally applicable way to represent state in a language that has no mutatable state. Monads seem to act as functions whose return values can work as state accumulators when chained together. Using monads under the covers, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">do</code> statement lets you write imperative looking code, but it’s actually chained together with monads and winds up boiling down to one big function invocation. That top-level conceptual understanding is where I stopped—exactly how to implement and practically use a monad was still a mystery to me after a section’s worth of examples.</p>

<h3 id="thanks-for-all-the-lambdas">Thanks For All The Lambdas</h3>

<p>At the end of this chapter, my trepidation unfortunately seemed justified. Perhaps it was a bit of new language burn-out or perhaps it was Haskell’s vertical learning curve, but I had a hell of a time getting as much out of Haskell as I did out of the other languages the book covered.  Frustration with Haskell aside, I had a blast with <em>Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</em>. Covering big swaths of intellectual territory is always fun, and I’ve got a non-trivial desire to start a deep dive into Clojure soon. Time to get back to building things.</p>

        </a>
      </h2>
      <div class="article-wrap" itemprop="text">
        <p>I’ve been looking forward to digging into Clojure ever since I saw Rich Hickey’s <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/860-railsconf2012-keynote-simplicity-matters">keynote at RailsConf2012</a>. I’m still chewing on some of the philosophy Rich introduces in that talk, and wanting to seeing his approach to language design was a big part of why I picked up <em>Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</em> in the first place. Plus, I haven’t had the chance to mess around with a Lisp since that semester in college of finding myself in the empty list…</p>

<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>Clojure is a Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM, with data and code alike represented in lists. The oft-quoted complaint about “Lisp parenthesis soup” is helped by syntactic suger for Clojure’s basic collection types: associative maps are denoted with <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code>s, sets use <code class="highlighter-rouge">#{}</code> and vectors have<code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code>s. Even in just a couple days with the language, the parenthesis just become a form of whitespace when visually scanning properly indented Clojure.</p>

<p>These basic data structures in Clojure feel very well thought out, with Sequences serving as a common abstraction over most collections. Sequences are simply anything that implements the following interface: get the first element, get the rest of the sequence without the first element, and add an element to the front of the sequence (car, cdr, and cons for you Schemers playing along at home). Sequences can be lazy, allowing for some pretty powerful generator-like effects.</p>

<p>Clojure’s tools for working with these sequences are great. The usual functional suspects are there: <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldl</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code>, along with a terse form for anonymous functions. There’s also some new stuff: the <code class="highlighter-rouge">take</code> function grabs a finite number of elements from the front of a sequence- so given a lazy sequence computing the fibonacci numbers, you could get the first N with <code class="highlighter-rouge">(take N fibonaccis)</code>.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">interpose</code> works like Ruby’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">join</code>, but works on and returns a sequence, so can be chained with other operations. Clojure also sports one of the most powerful list comprehension forms I’ve seen, supporting an arbitrary number of clauses and filters, even acting over multiple collections.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-jvm">On the JVM</h3>

<p>Rather than attempt to remain platform agnostic, Clojure seems to embrace the JVM as its host environment. Just like Scala, native Java types make appearances all over the place, though without a great deal of friction. The book didn’t have the space to elaborate, but hinted at some pretty slick integration with native Java libraries. Beyond just existing code integration, Clojure gets to reap the man-centuries put into making the JVM fast, stable and possessed of one of the sophisticated garbage collectors out there.</p>

<p>Running on the JVM has its limitations. Without native support, Clojure has no tail recursion, although it provides a loop/recur construct for efficiently unrolling recursive calls.</p>

<p>Also interesting is that although Clojure binds itself tightly to the JVM, there are independent ports of the language to  <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">Javascript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/halgari/clojure-py">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/schani/clojurec">C</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr">.NET</a> and more…</p>

<h3 id="records-and-types-not-objects">Records and types, not objects</h3>

<p>Clojure eschews Java’s approach to object-oriented data modeling, particularly leaving behind the notion of class-based inheritance. Types are defined with <code class="highlighter-rouge">defrecord</code> and functions are grouped around types with <code class="highlighter-rouge">defprotocol</code>.  Types are immutable - instead of modifying a record in-place, you return a new, different copy. There’s an emphasis on just enough abstraction over the data; types behave like maps, so you can start with a simple associative data structure and just add more behavior when you need it.</p>

<p>Types can interact fully with other code on the JVM, although the implications of this are unclear to me. Can I pass Clojure records to other JVM languages and have their immutable semantics respected?</p>

<h3 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h3>

<p>Clojure’s functional approach and strong push for immutatable state were designed to aid writing concurrent programs. State mutations can <em>only</em> be done inside explict transactions that prevent concurrent modifications from attempting to muck with a value at once.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">atom</code> construct provides some sugar for concurrency-safe changes on a single value.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different mechanics to actually executing code in parallel.  Agents can do asynchronous processing with the same thread-safe transactional access mechanics as atoms.  Reading a value from a reference, agent, or atom won’t lock or block - updated values are just flipped in transactionally. So you might get an out-of-date value, but never one in an inconsistent state. Futures are another option for concurrency: they evaluate asynchronously, but reading their value returned blocks until evaluation is finished.</p>

<h3 id="clojure-runs-deep">Clojure runs deep</h3>

<p>My brief tour of Clojure had me recalling the ‘oh, wow’ feeling I felt learning Python for the first time after a few years of Java and C++. Clojure’s got some powerful ideas that I’m going to be trying to wrap my head around for a while. There’s a fit-togetherness about the language that makes me want to dig into it further. This is the first language in <em>Seven Language In Seven Days</em> that made me go out and buy a book on it before I was even done with the chapter—I’ll be tucking into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449394701">Clojure Programming</a> just as soon as I’m done with Haskell.</p>
