<p>Paths will be 38 sqft + 29sqft, so 67 sq ft total</p>

<p>4&quot; deep of crusher run - 1 cubic yard</p>

<p>1&quot; deep of sand - 1/4 cubic yard</p>

<p>Ask about prices for mulch and soil (loam).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/how-to/how-to-lay-brick-path">How to Lay a Brick Path | This Old House</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>Determine width of path, add 2”. Mark w/ spray or garden hose. Dig out top layer of soil until you see the color of the soil change. Place excavated soil on tarp.</li>
	<li>Lay down 1-2” of graded base. Spray w/ water to keep dust down.</li>
	<li>Tamp down layer of base to settle/compress it, using a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Asphalt-10-in-x-10-in-Welded-Steel-Head-And-Handle-Tamper-19-153/305979357">hand tamper</a>. Add another few inches of graded base and repeat until 3.5” below grade.</li>
	<li>Adding on a sand layer.

		<ol>
			<li>Make a “screed”—cut down a 2x4” to 6” longer than the path’s width, then make notches with a handsaw that are 3.25” wide and high as a brick laid flat.</li>
			<li>Make narrow trenches with a spade along the edge of the graded base and pound in 1x4s until they are level with the grade. Work way down until both sides are lined. Drive wooden stakes about 12” into the ground against the rails at 3’ intervals. Secure each stake to the rails with 2x1.25” deck screws, then cut to flush w/rail.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Grade the path: cut a small scrap of wood to 1/8” for every foot the path is wide. Tape it to the end of a 4’ level. Rest level across rails, w/ scrap on top of the rail on the lower side of path. Tap rail into ground until level reads as level. Pour 2” masonry sand or stone dust between rails. Place screed across rails and pull it down the path to even out surface and fill in low spots. If needed, add more sand and tamp, then pull screed across another time.</li>
	<li>Dig out a shallow trench 2.5” deep alongside both rails. Lay brick on edge inside trench and pound flush w/ dead-blow mallet. Use level w/ scrap wood to check slop. Run bricks down each side.</li>
	<li>Widen notches on screed so it’ll fit between edge bricks w/ 1/4” wiggle room. Screed again. Lay down pattern between edging: hold brick above sand, press against edge brick and set down directly in place (to not disturb sand. Tap level with rest of bricks using mallet. Fill in path. Check slop w/ level + scrap as you go.</li>
	<li>Fill in joints: shovel thin layer of masonry sand or stone dust over top of path. Using a big push broom, sweep sand into joints. Wet path w/ hose to settle the sand, then brush more wet sand into cracks until tightly packed. Let sand settle for one week, refilling settled joints w/ more sand. After one week more, unscrew stakes and remove rails. Finish sides w/ garden edging.</li>
</ol>

<p>Similar, though less fussy instructions in Better Homes and Gardens Landscaping book, p. 84.</p>

<p>More edging ideas on p. 96 of Better Homes and Gardens Landscaping book. Landscaping timber / railroad ties are probably too beefy for path edging in beds, but could be lower-effort edging for brick paths? Also maybe treated 2x4s.</p>

<h2>Surround Vegetable Beds With Gravel Paths</h2>

<p>Lawn Gone, Pam Penick, p. 99</p>

<ol>
	<li>Dig out dirt/sod to 4”. </li>
	<li>Install edging: bender board, bricks, flexible steel. Don’t use plastic, will pop out. </li>
	<li>If using pea gravel: compact a 2” base of granite dust or decomposed granite, then spread 2” of pea gravel over it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Replace Grass With Perennial Beds</h2>

<p><strong>Removing Grass:</strong> Per Lawn Gone p.82, we can just dig it up with a shovel unless there’s invasive stuff like Bermuda grass (whose range is more southernly than us). </p>

<ol>
	<li>Water area a few days beforehand if it’s been dry.</li>
	<li>Cut out section w/ shovel, pull up section and shake soil off roots of grass.</li>
	<li>Compost grass.</li>
</ol>

<p>Edging: should we use bricks?</p>

<p>Lawn Gone p. 110: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Add a generous layer of 4-6” compost-enriched topsoil. Add compost each year around new plants.</li>
	<li>When selecting plants, you’ll get a more cohesive look with fewer species planted in swathes. <em>Fewer plants and more of them.</em></li>
	<li>Spread 2-3” of organic material mulch after planting. Be careful to keep it pulled back from the base of trees. 

		<ul>
			<li>How much to get: (area in feet * depth in inches) / 324 = result is number of cubic yards needed. This formula works for soil and gravel, too!</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>BH&amp;G book says plant perennials mid-spring.</p>

<p>The Well Tended Perennial Garden p. 30</p>

<ul>
	<li>Small plants (&lt; 1’ tall) should be 8-12” apart, plant in front</li>
	<li>Medium (1’-2.5’ tall) should be 15-24” apart, plant in middle</li>
	<li>Larger plants should be planted 2-3’ apart</li>
	<li>Spacing of 15” seems to be a good rule of thumb for most perennials </li>
	<li>Page 30 has table of spacing to number of plants per square foot</li>
	<li>Test soil with soil testing kits to determine conditions (pH, soil type, and so on). </li>
	<li>Don’t worry about trying to adjust pH unless everything else is squared away and you’re still having issues.</li>
	<li>Recommends using Round-Up to eliminate grass / weeds before bed prep.</li>
	<li>Adding organic matter (“soil amendments”) can help drainage

		<ul>
			<li>To test drainage, dig 12” diameter hole to depth of amendments. Fill w/ water and let drain, then fill w/ water again. If second fill doesn’t drain within an hour, drainage is poor and probably requires more amendments.</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Watering</h2>

<p>The Well Tended Perennial Garden p. 61:</p>

<p>Rule of thumb is 1” water / week while plants are being established. Use a rain gauge to measure.</p>

<h3>Specific Plants</h3>

<h4>Big</h4>

<p><strong>Lilac</strong> can get pretty big — 3-20 feet. Like full sun. Should be great for west front side of house, maybe something smaller by gutter / gate on east side.</p>

<h4>Medium</h4>

<h4>Short</h4>

<p><strong>Hardy Plumbago</strong> — rec’d in Lawn Gone, more <a href="https://www.highcountrygardens.com/ceratostigma-plumbaginoides">details here</a>. 8-12” high / 18” wide. Ground cover, easy to grow, fine in direct sun. Leafs out late in spring, but keeps trucking until frost (so mix with an early bird). Goes mahogany red in fall.</p>

<h2>Vegetable Beds</h2>

<p>Liz is making initial plans. </p>

<p>Do we want to move the beds at all?</p>

<p>Per Dad: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Epson salt and bone meal for peppers</li>
	<li>Maybe look into BT (non-chemical insecticide) for anti-aphid work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Misc Todo</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Route east front side gutter under fence.</li>
	<li>Should we get a second composter? We’ll have grass + next years leaves, plus mower has a mulching bag.</li>
</ul>
