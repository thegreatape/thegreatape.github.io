<h1>Principals of Digital Minimalism</h1>

<ol>
	<li><em>Clutter is costly</em>: The costs of having your attention pulled by too many apps and services overwhelms the benefits.</li>
	<li><em>Optimization is important</em>: To get the most of out of the technology you chose to use, it’s critical to be carefully strategic in how and when you chose to employ it.

		<ul>
			<li>Interesting observation about the law of diminishing returns: a small amount of time carefully invested in a particular technology is actually more likely to bring the most benefit for the least time invested. </li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><em>Intentionality is satisfying</em>: Being intentional in one’s use of tech is satisfying in and of itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I am finding the ideas here compelling without necessarily finding Newport’s arguments for them convincing.</p>

<h1>Declutter (started 2/10/19)</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Set aside 30 days to take a break from optional, non-critical technologies</li>
	<li>Reconnect with satisfying / meaningful activities during that time period</li>
	<li>Afterwards, slowly reintroduce tech you find:

		<ul>
			<li>Still supports things that you deeply value</li>
			<li>Is the <em>best</em> way to use technology to further this value</li>
			<li>With a plan for how to optimize value for time invested—the “how &amp; when” to use it.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Plan beforehand what you will replace the time you’re currently spending on optional tech</li>
	<li>Use <em>operating procedures</em> when there’s an optional tech with a few critical-path uses—that is, specify how and when exactly you will use said tech</li>
</ul>

<h2>List Of Banned Technologies</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Instagram</li>
	<li>Youtube</li>
	<li>Reddit</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>HN / lobste.rs / tech news sites</li>
	<li>all news sites</li>
	<li>gaming sites</li>
	<li>SFF sites</li>
	<li>Goodreads (use mobile app to access reading list)</li>
	<li>Video games (may play with Liz)</li>
	<li>Newsblur</li>
</ul>

<h2>List Of Activities To Replace Said Technologies</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Professional investment time: go deeper on a tech used at work, read the docs and take notes</li>
	<li>Finish workout log entry</li>
	<li>Finish Rust book</li>
	<li>Learning to draw: Proko courses?</li>
	<li>Alfred workflow for getting link to Ulysses sheet</li>
	<li>Alfred workflow for publishing notes from Ulysses</li>
	<li>Plan spring garden</li>
	<li>Working on fixing basement floor</li>
	<li>Extra mobility work</li>
	<li>Read and take notes on articles saved in Pocket</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interesting Practice Ideas</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Long walks (yeah, already doing with the doggo)</li>
	<li>Writing letters to yourself (journaling?)</li>
	<li>Use tech to facilitate in-person interaction (instead of replacing it)

		<ul>
			<li>Consolidate the use of these tools (e.g. texting) to set times during the day. For example, only check your text messages at a few scheduled times during the day.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Make leisure plans:

		<ul>
			<li>Seasonal, goal-oriented ones</li>
			<li>Weekly schedules blocking out time and listing habits</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Join in-person groups</li>
	<li>For low-quality leisure time: schedule and timeblock it (ex. you can surf / check feeds for 30 minutes after lunch on Saturday)</li>
	<li>Build or fix something every week, ideally with your hands</li>
	<li>Make your computers (mobile and desktop) able to become single-purpose devices for whatever purpose you need at the time</li>
	<li>Embrace “slow media”: find the best, high-quality source of info, pare them down to the minimum needed and consume them on a schedule.</li>
	<li>Use social media “like a professional”: figure out what you need, get it with as little time / interaction as you can.</li>
</ul>
