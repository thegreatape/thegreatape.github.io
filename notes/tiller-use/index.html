<h1>Tiller Use</h1>

<p>To balance budget, move money from rollover to other rolloversâ€”they basically represent envelopes with cash or an IOU in them. E.g to cover a negative rollover, either move money from expense category w/ positive balance or from extra income.</p>

<p>Adjusting the budgeted amount means adjusting the <strong>plan</strong> for how much to set aside this month for the category.</p>
